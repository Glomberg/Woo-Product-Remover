# Woo Product Remover
Woo Product Remover is a wordpress / woocommerce plugin that allows you to, via a single click, remove all woocommerce products from your site. It cleans up your database from products, their metadata, relationships, as well as product variations and their related meta data.
Such functionality is not available as part of wordpress / woocommerce, nor has been properly implemented via other plugins to cover all related aspects.
